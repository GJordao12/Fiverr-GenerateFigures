# Generate Figures - Fiverr Project

* **Languages and Tools:** HTML and JavaScript
* **Project Description:** The objective of this project was to create an [HTML Page](/index.html) that at each refresh showed a different figure and its name. The figures and their names are randomly generated using the code present in the [Sketch File](/sketch.js). Still regarding the figures, these can be of one gender (male or female) and can have items, pets, and other things that may or may not appear depending on their rarity.
* **Figure Example:**
